tinyirc for Debian
------------------

Note: The package came with a copy of RFC 1459, however, it added
about 15k or so to the binary package. That is, as you will note, the
approximate size of the tinyirc binary itself, so, I decided that it
would be best to simply point you to the location of the RFC (as its
somewhat interesting reading) instead of shipping a copy:
